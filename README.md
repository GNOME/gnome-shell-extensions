# GNOME Shell Extensions

GNOME Shell Extensions is a collection of extensions providing additional
and optional functionality to GNOME Shell.

The extensions in this package are supported by GNOME and will be updated
to reflect future API changes in GNOME Shell.

Both the most recent stable release and the previous stable release of
GNOME Shell are actively supported, as well as the current development
branch.

Please refer to the [schedule] to see when a new version will be released.

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME [bug tracking system][bug-tracker].

[schedule]: https://release.gnome.org/calendar

## Extensions

 * alternate-tab (**OBSOLETE**)
 
     Lets you use classic Alt+Tab (window-based instead of app-based) in GNOME Shell.
     This extension is obsolete since GNOME 3.30, see [this blogpost][alternatetab-post]
     for further details.

 * apps-menu

     Lets you reach an application using gnome 2.x style menu on the panel.

 * auto-move-windows

     Lets you manage your workspaces more easily, assigning a specific workspace to
each application as soon as it creates a window, in a manner configurable with a
GSettings key.

 * drive-menu
 
     Shows a status menu for rapid unmount and power off of external storage devices
  (i.e. pendrives)

 * launch-new-instance

     Changes application icons to always launch a new instance when activated.

 * native-window-placement

     An alternative algorithm for layouting the thumbnails in the windows overview, that
  more closely reflects the actual positions and sizes.

 * places-menu

     Shows a status Indicator for navigating to Places.

 * screenshot-window-sizer

     Adds a shortcut for resizing the focus window to a size that is suitable for GNOME Software screenshots. Ctrl + Alt + s cycles forwards through the available sizes and Ctrl + Alt + Shift + s cycles backwards.

 * user-theme

     Loads a shell theme from ~/.themes/<name>/gnome-shell.

 * window-list

     Adds a bottom panel with a traditional window list.

 * windowsNavigator

     Allow keyboard selection of windows and workspaces in overlay mode.

 * workspace-indicator

     Adds a simple workspace switcher to the top bar.
