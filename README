GNOME Shell Extensions is a collection of extensions providing additional
and optional functionality to GNOME Shell.

Since GNOME Shell is not API stable, extensions work only against a very
specific version of the shell, usually the same as this package (see
"configure --version"). The extensions in this package are supported by GNOME
and will be updated to reflect future API changes in GNOME Shell.

Bugs should be reported at https://bugzilla.gnome.org against the 'gnome-shell'
product, with the 'extensions' component.
