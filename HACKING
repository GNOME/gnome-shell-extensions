--- Creating a New Extension ---

To create a new extension, add a subdirectory in extensions.
Then create a Makefile.am like the one in example, replacing
the EXTENSION_ID with the basename of your extension, which
must match the UUID in metadata.json.
If you need additional files, add them to EXTENSION_EXTRA.

Then modify extensions/Makefile.am and configure.ac. It should
be pretty self-explanatory.

Don't forget to add any translatable file to po/POTFILES.in, and
then you're done.
The Gettext domain you should choose is gnome-shell-extensions,
not gnome-shell, unless you're sure there is the string you
need in gnome-shell.

--- Coding Style ---

Generally, we follow GJS coding style (you can find it at
http://git.gnome.org/browse/gjs/tree/doc/Style_Guide.txt), which
in short is: indent 4 spaces, no tabs, space after comma, no space
after function call.

The Emacs mode line for this
/* -*- mode: js2; js2-basic-offset: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil -*- */

Imports should be at the top, in two groups, one for standard
imports (like imports.lang or imports.dbus) and introspection,
the other for Shell API. Within the same group, put everything
in alphabetic order.
